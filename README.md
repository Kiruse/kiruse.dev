# kiruse.dev
is my personal website, and this is its Open Source repository - for referential or educational purposes.

The website is built as a static, serverless, portfolio-type website. For development efficiency, I employ various technologies:

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) + [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to transpile & compress Vanilla JS & TS to ES5
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) for modular & compressed CSS
* prerendered [Pug](https://pugjs.org) for cleaner HTML
* [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for serverless mechanics, e.g. lambda functions such as the contact form
* [anime.js](https://animejs.com) for dynamic animations
* [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) because I can't be bothered with the old-school hastle
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting

The entire website is built from scratch, save for above technologies. No frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [jQuery](https://jquery.org) were employed.
